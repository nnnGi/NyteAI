# NyteAI
Generative AI using Google Gemini (Imagen, Text and Code Running)

Python Libraries Required:\
    - PIL\
    - Google-GenerativeAi\
    - io

This AI program can generate text and images and run code (mostly Python).
It is NyteAI or SwiftAI, written by @\_nnn_ (A.K.A @FlyBoyAce2) in Python 3.13.2

Generate 2 Gemini API keys and put both in their corresponding variables below in the # API Keys Section
Generate Gemini API Keys at https://aistudio.google.com/

Models Used:
```
DISTRIBUTION_MODEL = 'gemini-2.0-flash-lite' // Chooses whether to use text or image generation model
TEXT_GEN_MODEL = 'gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp' // Experimentive Text Generation Model with Thinking Abilities and Code Running Capabilities
IMAGE_GEN_MODEL = 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation' // Experimentive Image Generation Model
```

This programme pulls on two instances of Google Gemini:
    1. Check if the user request wants AI to generate text or image or to end the programme
    2. Fufil request with corresponding model (Text or Imagen)

#Possible Errors when Running NyteAI
```python
raise Exception("ModelActivationError: Distribution Model failed to activate Text or Imagen Model")
```
Occurs when the distribution model fails to return a result that can activate either model, which means that the output did not contain ```Text```, ```Image``` or ```Quit```
